This program is designed to take data from DUMSES and generate visualizations.
It assumes that DUMSES is run with the buoyant_layer/v05 patch, which runs
simulations of a toy model analagous to the gain region in core-collapse
supernovae.  The x-axis is a priveleged direction, with the initial conditions
created as a 1D steady-state (variation only along x) plus perturbations, and
gravity points along the x-axis.
